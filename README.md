# Enhancing Code Quality and Efficiency with ChatGPT

Welcome to a specialized module of our IT curriculum where we explore innovative ways to integrate artificial intelligence into everyday coding practices. This project focuses on two pivotal aspects of software development: **debugging** and **automation**.

By engaging with these tasks, you‚Äôll learn how to harness the capabilities of ChatGPT to:
- Identify and resolve coding errors more efficiently
- Automate repetitive coding tasks
- Boost productivity and code quality

---

## üß† Objectives

### Debugging
Use ChatGPT to:
- Analyze and identify bugs in code samples across multiple programming languages
- Correct errors and improve code functionality
- Strengthen problem-solving and code comprehension skills

### Automation
Use ChatGPT to:
- Generate boilerplate code, documentation, and unit tests
- Eliminate repetitive tasks in coding workflows
- Focus more on complex and creative software design tasks

---

## ‚úÖ Outcomes

- **Enhanced Debugging Skills**  
  Diagnose and fix issues faster using AI-assisted tools.

- **Automation Proficiency**  
  Leverage ChatGPT to automate documentation, test generation, and more for structured, error-free code.

- **Critical Thinking**  
  Evaluate AI-suggested changes for correctness, relevance, and best practices.

### `0. Debugging - Python Factorial`
**File:** `factorial.py`  
Fix a logic bug in a factorial function that causes an infinite loop.

---

### `1. Debugging - Python Arguments`
**File:** `print_arguments.py`  
Modify the script to print only the provided arguments, not the script name.

---

### `2. Debugging - HTML / JavaScript`
**File:** `change_background.html`  
Fix a typo in the button ID that prevents the background color from changing.

---

### `3. Debugging - Python Mines`
**File:** `mines.py`  
Implement win-condition detection for a console-based Minesweeper game.

---

### `4. Documentation - Python Factorial (Recursive)`
**File:** `factorial_recursive.py`  
Add documentation: function description, parameters, and return values.

---

### `5. Error Handling - Python Checkbook`
**File:** `checkbook.py`  
Add error handling for user input to prevent crashes on invalid values.

---

### `6. Debugging - Tic Tac Toe Python`
**File:** `tic.py`  
Fix logical errors in game logic, validate user inputs, and ensure correct winner detection.

## üí° Tips

- Always test and verify AI-generated code before using it in production.
- Cross-reference changes against official documentation or style guides.
- Use ChatGPT iteratively: ask questions, refine prompts, and dig deeper when unsure.
